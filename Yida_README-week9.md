# Yida README Week 9

## Design & MISC

- Specified the requirements of the matching algorithm in `Matching Algorithm Specification.md`
- Organized the thoughts and described the proposed algorithm in `Scheduling Model Optimization.md`
- Worked with Fengxiang to discuss the details on implementation and some parameters. 

### Implementation

- Add some barebone code and helper methods in `euclid_schedule/matching.py`
- Add some barebone code for task scheduling for matching in `euclid_schedule/tasks.py`

## Todo for Week 10

- Finish up the implementation of matching algorithm
- Work with Fengxiang for Integration test
- Wrap-up
